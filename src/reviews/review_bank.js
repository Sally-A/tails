                    She is gentle and patient with my pup as she is getting up there in age.  
                    My dog is always excited to see Carla.  Our whole family loves her sparkling personality. 
                    We highly recommended Tails Of The Town`

        message: `Carla is just simply the best. I rescued my little girl Gabriella from a very traumatic situation and she was terrified of everything and everyone, 
        especially groomers. Carla won her over the first time they met. Her kind, loving and nurturing approach to animals is amazing. 
        Plus, she adds in some magic like lavender essential oil, bath time massage, gentle kind and loving words. 
        The end results are a beautifully groomed dog who has just enjoyed a very pleasant day at the spa.`

        message: `Carla has been our groomer for close to two years now. We have a Great Pyrenees and Carla has been the only groomer for Ellie. 
        The bond that they have is so amazing, and every groom is perfect. She's even helped with our other two large dogs, both Doberman/Shepherd mixes. 
        The attention to detail and compassion that Carla has are just a few reasons why we will continue to go to Carla for all of our grooming needs.`

        message: `Carla Sadler  is the best dog groomer. If your looking for someone to take great care of your pups, she’s your gal. 
        She grooms our 2 boxers and Pomeranian. She takes great pride in her work and has that touch that all animals just love her. 
        If you have a nervous dog,  she keeps your pups feeling safe and calm. 
        My lil Pom is very nervous and she’s able to keep him calm and does an amazing job on making his coat look nice and fluffy. 
        I wouldn’t trust my dogs with anyone else. Highly recommend!`

        message: `Carla is exactly what our dogs needed in their lives!  We have Zoey, a chunky little 7yr old pittie and Jet, a 2yr old rottie.  
        They don't get hair cuts but she has turned our nail trimming stressfests into a breeze and we ALL could not be more thankful.  
        When we started, Zoey was a struggle to even clip and Jet would run for the door as soon as he saw the clippers.  
        The very first visit Carla was able to use a dremil on Zoey!  She had some tricks for getting Jet to relax and now a year later, 
        he will give me his paw on command and let me clip his nails!  She is like a nervous-dog whisperer.  
        I don't know what it is, she soothes them at the same time she's asserting so much confidence.  
        They just fall into line for her and trust her.`
